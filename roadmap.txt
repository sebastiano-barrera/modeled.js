- [...] scoping rules (declaration hoisting, etc.)
- [x] unify break/continue logic across different loop types (while, do while, for in, for, etc.)

- [ ] impl parseInt
- [ ] function captures (don't these work already?)
- [ ] "holey" arrays (empty, rather than undefined, elements)
- [ ] patterns as assignment targets
- [ ] patterns as function parameters
